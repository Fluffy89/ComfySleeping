## Overview

Comfy Sleeping is a mod that adds a comfort mechanic to sleeping in Project Zomboid. It does this by adding a blend of risk vs. reward to sleeping fully geared up at the cost of sleep quality, or stripping off the big bulky survival gear to get a proper nights rest.

In essense, the mod takes into account the following, and calculates a comfort modifier to determine how comfortable the player is:
 - Mental condition (stress)
 - Physical condition (hyper/hypothermia, sickness, hunger, thirst, etc)
 - Equipped weaponry/clothing/backpacks
 - General cleanliness (blood and dirt on the player)
 
Depending on the players comfort modifier, they will fall into one of 6 comfort levels (default comfort begins at 100 with a modifier of 0):
 1. **Snug as a bug** (Comfort > 100)
	- Player wakes up faster than usual, and doesn't oversleep once their fatigue hits 0.
 
 2. **Ok** (80 < Comfort < 100)
	- Player feels no change in sleep quality. The vanilla sleeping experience.
 
 3. **Tolerable** (60 < Comfort < 80)
	- Endurance is slightly impacted.
 
 4. **Bad** (40 < Comfort < 60)
	- Endurance is moderately impacted.
	- Fatigue is slightly impacted.
 
 5. **Poor** (20 < Comfort < 40)
	- Endurance is highly impacted.
	- Fatigue is moderately impacted.
	- Player becomes restless and wakes up after several hours.
 
 6. **Very Poor** (Comfort <= 20)
	- Endurance is significantly impacted.
	- Fatigue is highly impacted.
	- Player becomes restless and wakes up after a few hours.
