description=[h1][u]Purpose & How It Works[/u][/h1]
description=This mod was created from an idea I saw on Reddit (thanks to user Garrett-Wilhelm) in the Zomboid subreddit. It seemed like an interesting and immersive way to add some depth to Zomboid, so here we are!
description=
description=Comfy Sleeping adds a comfort mechanic to sleeping, where what your character wears, how they feel, and how dirty/bloody they are contribute to sleep quality. If your characters comfort is high (light/cloth clothing, clean, backpack unequipped), you will get a great nights rest and wake up faster than normal. However, the lower your characters comfort (big bulky clothing, dirty, wearing backpack, hungry, over encumbered, etc), the worse their sleep quality will be. This can range anywhere from slight endurance loss, to waking up several times throughout the night.
description=
description=A characters comfort is displayed in the tooltip for the "Sleep" context option. Pillow status is also displayed here. Sleeping in a vehicle will display your comfort in the sleep confirmation text box.
description=
description=Comfort has 6 different levels:
description=[list]
description=[*]Snug as a bug: Fatigue and exertion will regenerate slightly faster while sleeping, meaning you will also wake up quicker than usual.
description=
description=[*]OK: Your character feels comfortable and has no negative effects.
description=
description=[*]Tolerable: Your character won't feel fully recharged when waking up, meaning their exertion/stamina doesn't go to 100% while sleeping
description=
description=[*]Bad: Your character feels more tired in the morning than usual, with a small amount of fatigue and exertion/stamina not fully regenerating.
description=
description=[*]Poor: Your character doesn't recharge a sizeable portion of their fatigue and exertion. They will also wake up after several hours, and may have neck pain.
description=
description=[*]Very Poor: Your character doesn't recharge a significant amount of their fatigue and exertion. They will wake up after only a few hours, and may have neck pain.

description=[h1][u]FAQ (READ BEFORE COMMENTING)[/u][/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Is Comfy Sleeping compatible with B42 IWBUMS?[/u][/b]
description=[/list]
description=Probably, TIS said there has been significant lua/script changes, but as far as I can tell, Comfy Sleeping appears to work fine for B42.
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Does this mod have any incompatibilities?[/u][/b] 
description=[/list]
description=Since this mod doesn't replace any Zomboid files, nor modify any of the vanilla game's code, there should not be any incompatibilities with other mods.
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Does this mod work in SP/Coop/Dedicated MP?[/u][/b] 
description=[/list]
description=Yes it works in all 3! It was intended & tested to work with MP, and because the code is handled client side, it should have no issue with either SP or Coop saves.
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][b][u]Is this safe to add to a current save?[/u][/b] 
description=[/list]
description=Yes it is safe to add and remove at will! All of the code in the mod is custom, meaning it doesn't need to hook in to or modify any of the vanilla game code. If the mod is enabled, you'll have the comfort mechanics, if not, then you won't!

description=[*][b][u]I'm adding this to an existing SP save, how do I change the sandbox options mid save?[/u][/b]

description=Use a mod such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670674997#:~:text=You%20can%20change%20the%20Sandbox,some%20time%20or%20restart%20game.]Change Sandbox Options[/url] to modify them.

description=[h1][u]KNOWN ISSUES[/u][/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*][b]Comfort not showing in Sleep context option:[/b] There seems to be an issue potentially related to Act 1 & 2 of True Actions, lying down on beds or other furniture causes the Sleep UI to no longer report the players comfort level. Hovering over the Sleep option of a bed/couch/chair and not sitting on it still works as normal.
description=
description=[*][b]Comfort calculation bug[/b]: Some users have reported their comfort being stuck at 'very poor' after sleeping with exercise fatigue. Need to find out reproduce-able steps, game version, and, if needed, investigate comfort calculations.
